# Global warming

> In this capstone project, it is based on an online website for a conference. They provided me with design guidelines to create the website ([design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015)), but I have to customize the content, i.e. instead of a lecture, I built a website for a development course Web.The content of my project was based on global warming
